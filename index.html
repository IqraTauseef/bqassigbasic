<h2>SHAMI KEBAB</h2>
<hr>
<p>If youâ€™re Pakistani, itâ€™s likely your mom/relative/aunty has a shami kebab freezer stash waiting for the next unexpected guest, hungry 
child, or lazy evening to  strike. (Chicken Puff Pastry is also a great freezer friendly appetizer to stash away.)</p>
<p>
  Itâ€™s a somewhat prevalent practice, and with good reason. It means when life gets busy, there will be shami kebabs 
  within armâ€™s reach. Silky, wholesome, deeply flavorful kebabs ready to be thawed, pan-fried and served to a someone whoâ€™ll likely be grateful for them.
<br>  Shami kebab are not only freezer friendly â€“ as in no detectable change in texture, quality, or taste â€“ theyâ€™re also incredibly versatile. 
  Have them with your afternoon chai, as a side to make any dinner menu more abundant, or, my favorite, in a shami kebab sandwich drizzled with ketchup or hot and sour sauce.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE SHAMI KEBAB</h2>
<p>Shami Kebab are one of those kitchen endeavors that look a lot more intimidating than they actually are. Hereâ€™s a walk-through:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Grind the whole spices to make a shami kabab masala. If you donâ€™t have a spice/coffee grinder, you may also use a mortar and pestle, though this will be more tedious.</li>
 <li>Add the beef, lentils (dal/daal), onion, and spices to the Instant Pot or stovetop along with water. Cook. SautÃ© out extra moisture.</li>
 <li>Pulse to chop up an onion, a green chili pepper, and herbs in a food processor. Remove those and add the beef and lentil mixture. Process until smooth.</li>
 <li>Crack in an egg, mix everything and form into patties. Pan-fry.</li>
 <li>Awe at how simple it was to actually make these treasures all along.</li>
</ol>
